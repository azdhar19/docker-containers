## How to use this image

### Single instance mode

Get the docker image by running the following commands:

```bash
docker pull tommylau/apache
```

Start an instance:

```bash
docker run --name apache -v /path/to/web:/var/www/html -p 80:80 -d tommylau/apache
```

This will start an instance, and you are ready to go.

### Boot2Docker under Mac OS or Windows

If you are running [boot2docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker) under MacOS or Windows, it is a good idea to add `BOOT2DOCKER=1` as an environment variable. In this way, Apache2 will run under user `docker` (uid 1000) and group `staff` (gid 50), so that PHP won't complain about the permission denied when you try to write something to the disk through PHP, like say, upload an image to server.

```bash
docker run --name apache -v /path/to/web:/var/www/html -p 80:80 -e BOOT2DOCKER=1 -d tommylau/apache
```

### Linking with other containers

To use this image linking with MySQL, you have to have a running MySQL instance, more information about MySQL docker image, please refer to [tommylau/mysql](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/tommylau/mysql/). Suppose you have a MySQL instance named **mysql5.6_server**, we can link it in our Apache2 instance with the name **mysql** like this:

```bash
docker run --name apache -v /path/to/web:/var/www/html --link mysql5.6_server:mysql -p 80:80 -d tommylau/apache
```

Then in the instance, you can use the hostname `mysql` to connect to the database.
